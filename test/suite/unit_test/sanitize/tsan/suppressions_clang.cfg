# Current version assumption: clang-15/16/17.

# Had some issues matching ^ and $ in this one; leaving them out at times; these are very unlikely to match something
# unintentional.

# This suppression exists for (dependent-project) `ipc` (Flow-IPC) similar unit_test program(s),
# ipc/.../unit_test/sanitize/....  Actually
# that was written much before Flow's unit_test sprang into existence.  The suppression is short, but the reasoning
# for it is long/subtle.  See Flow-IPC's unit_test/sanitize/... for comment explaining it.
# Our situation is similar or at least not totally dissimilar, so we apply the same suppression.
#
# If this is changed, consider the Flow-IPC one; and vice versa.
