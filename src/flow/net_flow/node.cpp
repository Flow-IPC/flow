   *
   * If the arg is set to true, then the low-level UDP input code will allocate a 32k buffer exactly once per Node;
   * read up to 1k (+header overhead) into it.  Then DATA deserializer will copy the sub-sequence within that
   * up-to-1k-ish prefix of the 32k buffer that stores the actual DATA payload (which will be vast majority of
   * that up-to-1k) into a newly allocated buffer for that packet.  (This copy will then be moved around, to the
   * extent possible, eventually ending up [probably copied, ultimately] in the user's data structure of choice,
   * presumably first living in Receive buffer for the appropriate socket.)  Then for the next incoming packet,
   * the same original 32k buffer will be reused to store the deserialized data again; rinse/repeat.
   * So the total comes to: 1 32k allocation and deallocation; N up-to-1k allocations and deallocations; and
   * N up-to-1k copies; where N is # of DATA packets received (could be huge).
   *
   * If the arg is set to false, then the low-level UDP input code will allocate a 32k buffer once per DATA packet;
   * read up to 1k (+header overhead) into it.  Then DATA deserializer will MOVE the entire up-to-32k buffer including
   * up-to-1k-ish prefix within it that stores the actual DATA payload (which will be vast majority of
   * that up-to-1k) into the place where deserialized data are stored.  (This buffer (and information about which part
   * of it the actual DATA payload) will then be moved around, to the extent possible, eventually ending up [probably
   * copied, ultimately] in the user's data structure of choice, presumably first living in Receive buffer for the
   * appropriate socket.)  Then for the next incoming packet, the low-level UDP input code will have to reallocate
   * a new 32k buffer, because the deserializer "took" it for its own purpose (without copying it, thinking that's
   * faster, which it is -- in that limited context), so it cannot be reused; rinse/repeat.
   * So the total comes to: N 32k allocations and deallocations; but no copies; and N (quite cheap) moves; where
   * N is # of DATA packets received (could be huge).
   *
   * What is faster?  In practice (assuming a CPU-limited environment, meaning no loss, no delay, and a constant
   * stream of data being sent and received), at least on a localhost Mac setup, it turns out that the `true` way
   * is a bit faster, in that throughput is consistently higher by ~5%.  (This should be taken with grain of salt:
   * improvements in other areas of the code could make this impact become higher in proportion, etc. etc.)
   * This isn't too surprising; N-bytes alloc/copy/dealloc is bad, but a 32x-bigger alloca/dealloc can certainly
   * be worse.
   *
   * However, suppose we lower knob for "32k" to ~1k.  Then we have, essentially:
   * true => N 1k x alloc/copy/dealloc;
   * false => N 1k alloc/dealloc.
   *
   * In this case `false` might be somewhat better.  The good thing is that, as of this writing, all these values
   * have option knobs.  Of course, all this is subject to change and/or become automated over time.
   *
   * A huge caveat about the above discussion: Not all of the allocs/copies/deallocs occur in the same thread,
   * so in a multi-core environment, throughput might be improved by parallelism vs. the implications of above text.
   * Above could be rewritten to account for this; but at the moment the above should at least elucidate the issues
   * involved sufficiently for the reader to reason about this on their own. */

   * - Invalid fields:  If some field in the packet is simply erroneous, such as
   *   a negative number where a positive number is expected or something, the packet is
   *   simply dropped.  No RST is sent and no error is reported to the user (other than a log
   *   message).  This is similar to what at least the Zaghal/Khan FSM model for TCP describes, and
   *   it seems reasonable (and easy).  This only applies to fields that could never be right in any
   *   situation.
   * - Other errors:  More likely are other error situations, such as receiving a SYN to a socket
   *   that's in SYN_SENT state.  Since such problems can be a result of delayed packets or other
   *   conditions, there are various possibilities for response.  Examples:
   *   - Example: Getting SYN in SYN_SENT: always illegal but could happen due to delayed packets or
   *     freak coincidences; send RST and close connection.
   *   - Example: Getting SYN on a non-listening port: common error situation; send RST.
   *   - Example: Getting SYN_ACK twice: duplicate packet or result of loss; send SYN_ACK_ACK
   *     again and continue normally.
   *   - Example: Getting RST in ESTABLISHED: other side is resetting connection.  Close connection;
   *     don't respond with RST. */
