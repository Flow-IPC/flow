/**
 * A set of low-level options affecting a single Flow Node, including Peer_socket objects and other
 * objects subsequently generated by that Flow Node.  Typically these values can be left at
 * defaults, and thus the `net_flow` user normally need not deal with these objects.  However, if
 * low-level tuning of Flow internals is needed, you can use this `struct`.
 *
 * This is just a simple `struct` with a couple of utilities to serialize (to `ostream`) and deserialize
 * (from a config file or command line) the values in the `struct`; it is not connected to any other
 * object (for example, it can exist with no Node).
 *
 * You may read from and write to members of this `struct` at will, and no checking will be performed;
 * moreover, doing so will have no effect other than the field being read or written.
 *
 * Fields are validated and potentially take effect, however, when you pass a Node_options object
 * to Node.  Node always copies the given Node_options and never saves a reference to it.  All of
 * that applies equally to Peer_socket_options.
 *
 * Node_options contains a Peer_socket_options #m_dyn_sock_opts (a very similar, in spirit, `struct`)
 * within it.  Options stored within that are per-::flow::net_flow::Peer_socket
 * options.  For example, #m_st_low_lvl_max_buf_size
 * applies to the entire Node at all times and is stored directly in `*this` (as there is only one
 * UDP buffer for the entire Node); whereas max-block-size can be different for each
 * individual Peer_socket and is thus stored in `this->m_dyn_sock_opts`.  See Node::listen() and
 * Node::connect() for how per-socket options are distributed to subsequent sockets as connections
 * are made.
 *
 * The `struct`, when default-constructed, contains sane default values as used by Node when not
 * provided with a Node_options object.  Alternatively, you can get a Node's existing set of
 * options via Node::options().
 *
 * After obtaining a Node_options either way, you may assign values to it manually.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can fill it parsing a config file or command line using
 * boost.program_options (which makes it a snap) with the help of
 * Node_options::setup_config_parsing(), which will provide a program_options-suitable
 * #Options_description object to enable this parsing.  You may conversely print #Options_description
 * to an `ostream` (e.g., `cout`) for full help text on the meaning of each option and the defaults.
 *
 * You may also print a filled Node_options itself to an `ostream` for the current settings stored in
 * that object.
 *
 * ### Thready safety ###
 * Same as any `struct` with no locking done therein.
 *
 * @see Node constructor, Node::set_options(), Node::listen(), Node::connect().
 * @see Peer_socket::set_options(), Peer_socket::options().
 * @see Peer_socket_options.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * If you want to add an option, follow these steps:
 *
 *   1. Decide whether it's a per-socket or per-Node option (usually the former) and add it to
 *      Peer_socket_options or Node_options, respectively, using the below steps.
 *   2. Decide whether the option's value may be changed after the enclosing Node_options or
 *      Peer_socket_options has been accepted by a running Node or Peer_socket, respectively.  Most
 *      options tend to be static (cannot be changed once a Node or Peer_socket has accepted them).
 *      Based on this, the data member must start with `m_st_` (static) or `m_dyn_` (dynamic).  Choose
 *      the rest of the member name as well.
 *   3. Add the data member into the chosen `struct`.  Fully comment the meaning, as for other
 *      present options.
 *   4. Add an ADD_CONFIG_OPTION() line into the proper `struct` setup_config_parsing_helper() by analogy
 *      with other present options.  The description string should usually be a copy of the comment
 *      from step 3.
 *   5. Add the default value (very important) into the the proper `struct` constructor.
 *      Explain the choice of default with a comment.
 *   6. Is this a static option (step 2)?  If so, add static validation (by analogy with present
 *      options) to Node::validate_options() or Node::sock_validate_options().
 *   7. Add semantic validation (such as for illegal values, including illegal values due to
 *      inconsistency with other option values) to Node::validate_options() or
 *      Node::sock_validate_options().  For some options all values are legal, in which case you
 *      needn't add anything.
 *   8. Use the option.  EVERY read of the option should be performed through Node::opt() or
 *      Peer_socket::opt(), for thread safety.  The only exception is if you manually lock
 *      Node::m_opt_mutex or Peer_socket::m_opt_mutex, respectively.
