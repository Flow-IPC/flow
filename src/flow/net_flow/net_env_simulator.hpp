/**
 * Objects of this class can be fed to Node to make it internally simulate network conditions like
 * loss, latency, and data duplication.  At construction one provides parameters controlling those
 * phenomena; then when Node is about to receive or send some actual network traffic it asks this
 * object whether it should first simulate some phenomenon like a lost packet.  For example, if a
 * loss probability is given at construction, bool should_drop_received_packet() will return whether
 * the current received packet should be "dropped" instead of handled, which Node will simulate
 * internally by ignoring or handling the packet.
 *
 * This is not really meant as a replacement for real tools that simulate such phenomena (or
 * obviously the actual phenomena in a real network).  The way it simulates them is probably
 * unrealistic; for example a wide latency range given in the constructor will cause packets to be
 * re-ordered quite a bit, whereas on a real network the packets are more likely to arrive in the
 * right order but with widely varying latencies over time.  Anyway -- the idea of using this is not
 * to benchmark Node's performance under various network conditions; it is to test its correctness.
 * For example: do frequent packet duplications and drops cause Node to enter an unexpected state
 * and crash?  What happens when an ESTABLISHED socket receives a late re-ordered SYN_ACK after
 * already getting some DATA?  Etc. etc.
 *
 * @todo One thing we should probably add for a bit of realism is the following.  If a loss range
 * [A, B] is specified, an individual packet's simulated latency will be a uniformly random number
 * in that range.  Because of this there will be frequent re-ordering of packets: if range
 * is [50, 100] ms, and we physically get packet X at time 0 and packet Y at time 5 ms, and the
 * simulated latencies are 80, 60 ms, respectively, then Y will "arrive" 80 - 60 - 5 = 15 ms BEFORE
 * X despite being sent earlier (assuming perfect actual network conditions under the simulation).
 * In reality, packets aren't re-ordered all that often.  So if we wanted to simulate a high latency
 * without re-ordering, we'd have to set the range to [A, A] for some A.  To avoid having to do
 * that, we can add some internal memory into Net_env_simulator that would put a floor on a randomly
 * generated latency. In the previous example, the range for packet Y would be chosen as [75, 100]
 * (instead of [50, 100]) to guarantee that packet Y arrives at least a bit later than packet X.  Of
 * course that might skew the latency range in bursty traffic, but that might be an OK behavior.  We
 * could add a knob for how often to ignore this new logic and allow a re-ordering, so that that is
 * also simulated.

   * @param logger_ptr
   *        Logger to use for subsequently logging.
   * @param random_seed
   *        Random seed to use for the internal random number generator.  Assuming all else is equal
   *        (which can often be the case if all tested components are kept on the same
   *        machine/loopback), using the same seed twice to run the same operations should result in
   *        the same results.  If 0 is provided, seed is chosen based on the current time.
   * @param recv_packet_loss_prob
   *        Probability that the given received packet will get dropped instead of actually being
   *        received (0 is never; 1 is always; and anywhere in between).  This probability is
   *        applied only once elements of recv_packet_loss_seq run out.
   * @param recv_packet_loss_seq
   *        List of packet loss outcomes for received packets.  When packet `i` (in chronological
   *        order) is received, it is dropped instead of actually being received if the `i`-th element
   *        in `recv_packet_loss_seq` is true; otherwise it is not so dropped.  Once `i >=
   *        recv_packet_loss_seq.size()`, `recv_packet_loss_prob` is used instead.
   * @param recv_latency_range
   *        The range to use for the randomly generated latencies for received packets.  The pair
   *        specifies the [min, max] (inclusive) latency range in its first and second elements
   *        respectively.  The latency is chosen uniformly along that range.  This range is applied
   *        only once elements of `recv_latency_seq` run out.
   * @param recv_latency_seq
   *        List of latency outcomes for received packets.  When packet `i` (in chronological order)
   *        is received, it is lagged by N, where N is the `i`-th element in `recv_latency_seq`.  Once `i
   *        >= recv_latency_seq.size()`, `recv_latency_range is used instead.
   * @param recv_packet_dup_prob
   *        Probability that the given received packet will get duplicated in addition to actually
   *        being received (0 is never; 1 is always; and anywhere in between).  This probability is
   *        applied only once elements of `recv_packet_dup_seq` run out.
   * @param recv_packet_dup_seq
   *        List of packet loss outcomes for received packets.  When packet `i` (in chronological
   *        order) is received, it is duplicated in addition to actually being received if
   *        the `i`-th element in `recv_packet_dup_seq` is true; otherwise it is not so duplicated. Once
   *        `i >= recv_packet_dup_seq.size()`, `recv_packet_dup_prob` is used instead.
