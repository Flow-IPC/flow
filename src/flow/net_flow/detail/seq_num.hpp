/**
 * An internal `net_flow` sequence number identifying a piece of data.  While it would not be
 * hard to just deal with raw sequence numbers everywhere, it seemed prudent to wrap the raw number
 * in a light-weight object in order to make the interface abstract and be able to change the
 * implementation later.  For example, we may change the size of the number and how wrapping works
 * (and even whether there is wrapping), at which point we'd rather only change this class's
 * internals as opposed to code all over the place.  For example, operator+() may change from not
 * worrying about wrapping to worrying about it (and similarly for operator-()).
 *
 * The companion nested class Generator is used to generate the initial sequence number (ISN) for a
 * connection.
 *
 * What does one Sequence_number represent?  A byte or a packet?  This class is intentionally
 * ignorant of this.  It just deals with a number on the number line.  The user of the class is
 * responsible for such matters.
 *
 * ### Metadata ###
 *
 * Sequence numbers being used for a given purpose always have certain features to make them useful.
 * The following is a (n arguably overfly formal and detailed) discussion of those features and how
 * we support them via "metadata."
 *
 *   - Each sequence number line has a "zero" point Z, which is a sequence number such that it is more
 *     useful to specify a given absolute sequence number as (S - Z) with the corresponding explicit sign.
 *     So S = Z is written as =0, S > Z (most typical) is +M, S < Z (typically invalid)
 *     is -M, where M means magnitude, with M > 0.
 *   - Sometimes, in particular when individual sequence numbers represent individual sequential bytes in
 *     non-stop traffic (i.e., where user has more bytes than bandwidth can pass at any time, so there are
 *     always more bytes), and when the traffic is packetized into blocks of size B, it is convenient to
 *     specify the magnitude M as a multiple of B. This can be written as xN%R -- or just xN when R = 0 --
 *     where N = M / B, R = M % B.  If one chooses zero point Z just right (so that S = 0 represents the very
 *     first byte in the entire sequence), and there is so much traffic that there are no incomplete
 *     packets (i.e., of length < B) formed, then edge sequence numbers and packet (and multi-packet) ranges
 *     become extremely simple, small, convenient.
 *   - Consider Flow DATA/ACK sequence numbers in particular. The ISN is the value Si chosen for SYN message;
 *     therefore the very first byte has absolute number (Si + 1).  So let's set Z = (Si + 1). If only full
 *     packets are ever sent (which would be true if the Send buffer is always kept full by user, i.e.,
 *     pipe < user data supply, quite typical in test applications), then every single packet will have
 *     sequence number range [+x`N`, +x`(N + 1)`) (where `N` >= 0); and every single contiguous-packet range
 *     of I = 1 or more packets will thus have form [+x`N`, +x`(N + I)`).  Of course, B = max-block-size.
 *     - If one were to use absolute numbers instead, they would be incredibly far from zero and also multiples
 *       of many bytes (often that number, B, being something annoying like 8192 or even some odd number).
 *       That's a far cry from literally 0, 1, 2, ... (with %remainder kicking in, if an incomplete packet
 *       of DATA is generated for some reason).
 *     - CAUTION!  It's tempting -- for this particular application (or in TCP sequence numbers, as well) --
 *       to set Z = ISN.  However, the ISN, by convention, equals *1 less* than the first actual DATA
 *       byte's sequence number.  Always remember to set Z = ISN + 1 -- *even inside the ISN itself*!
 *   - Every sequence number line has some qualitative purpose; e.g., "Remote DATA-received sequence numbers" or
 *     "Local ACK-received sequence numbers."  This can be identified by a single letter prefix places in front
 *     of a number on the line.  E.g., a full number might look like: L-x23%1, which means S = Z - (23 x B + 1).
 *     The prefix is called "number line ID."
 *     - Note that Z and B themselves are hidden.  If computing S is ever necessary, one might have to hunt for
 *       it (or Z, B) in prior logs.  This is a cost that would be paid for the conciseness of L+x2 (for example)
 *       instead of 1285561384998534.
 *
 * Sequence_number has optional support for the above conventions.  While #m_num stores the basic absolute value S,
 * we also store the following, called *metadata*:
 *
 *   - Zero point, Z (#m_zero_point_num).
 *     - Z = 0 = default, is allowed.
 *       - However, by convention sign will be omitted from `ostream`-serialization -- since raw number is unsigned,
 *         and no non-zero numbers less than 0 exist.
 *       - Recall, also, that S = 0 itself is reserved/illegal by convention.
 *   - Multiple size, B (#m_multiple_size)
 *     - 0 = default, "none chosen".
 *       - `ostream`-serialization will avoid mentioning multiples/remainders.
 *   - Number line ID (#m_num_line_id).
 *     - `char(0)` = default, "none chosen".
 *       - `ostream`-serialization will simply feature no prefix.
 *
 * Use set_metadata() to set the full set of metadata.  For maximum effectiveness, consider these tips -- especially
 * vis-a-vis DATA/ACK-pertinent sequence numbers.
 *
 *   - Consider not calling set_metadata() on an incoming packet's various sequence number members until it has been
 *     logged (if appropriate) once.  Thus the raw number is available *if* necessary (hopefully never).
 *   - Remember that, by Flow-protocol (and, arguably, TCP) convention, Z = ISN + 1.  Z =/= ISN.  See above for details.
 *     - Even for the Sequence_number storing the ISN; actually, *especially* that one (see below re. copying)!
 *   - Importantly, every copy (`operator=()`, copy constructor),
 *     including many implicit invocations thereof (`operator+()`, associative storage, etc.), will always copy
 *     the metadata too.  Be sure to rely on this strongly!  If you set an ISN with its Z = ISN + 1 and B = socket's
 *     max-block-size; and then all other Sequence_number objects are copies (direct or otherwise) thereof, then
 *     they should have the proper metadata and will be beautifully logged as a result.  So just set the induction
 *     base and let the machinery work.
 *   - Metadata are not the actual data (#m_num = actual data) and absolutely do not participate in any
 *     comparison, arithmetic, or hash operations (which means they're also 100% ignored in associative lookups).
 *     So algorithms will work even if there's some bug with metadata.
 *
 * ### Thread safety ###
 * Equally thread-safe as built-in types (not safe to read/write or write/write one
 * object simultaneously).
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 *
 * Generator and Sequence_number work based on the same assumptions (like the
 * structure of the sequence number space), and thus their implementations may be related.  So if
 * one is changed the other may also need to be changed (internally).
