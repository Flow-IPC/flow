   * Of course this is not Reno but instead "classic with bandwidth estimation."  The difference is
   * that we set CWND not to 1/2 (or any other constant) of anything but rather to our best guess on
   * what the pipe can currently take.  The standard formula is CWND = B * RTT, where B is the
   * available bandwidth, and RTT is the delay of the pipe.  RTT is taken to be the minimum RTT
   * observed on the pipe, which should represent the "true" delay.  B is estimated using
   * Send_bandwidth_estimator.  Altogether this is the Westwood+ algorithm, but the main part of it
   * is the B estimation, which has been separated into Send_bandwidth_estimator, because its
   * results may be useful outside of congestion control.  For more info on Westwood+ see that
   * class's doc header.
   *
   * As a reference implementation of the CWND = B * RTT formula, we use Linux kernel's
   * tcp_westwood.c, which was implemented by the inventors of the algorithm. */
