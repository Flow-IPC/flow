   * m_zero_point).  If `use_multiple`, then much as we omitted the zero point value itself and just showed the sign
   * in its place, show the 'x' multiplication sign here; then show the multiple count, then "%R"; where R is the
   * remainder beyond the multiples, omitted if R = 0.  Finally, if `use_multiple`, then simply show the magnitude
   * (can think it of it as a multiple of 1, for which R = 0 always, and the 'x' is omitted).  Examples:
   * -x3 (3B to left of zero), +x2%5 (2B+5 to right of zero), x454324123 (454324123B absolute),
   * 454324123123 (454324123 absolute).
   *
   * Finally, what if magnitude IS zero?  For convenience to help interpret other numbers on the same line we use
   * this opportunity to print out the metadata set; and a simple indication that THIS value has magnitude 0.
   * Think of the format as a non-zero-magnitude value, with the "implied" (omitted) values in the previous paragraph
   * explicitly written out.  So, first is the sign, written as the zero point followed by the sign.
   * Next is the multiple, as the multiple followed by 'x'.  The coup de grace, is, simply '0', since that's what this
   * value is.  Finally, each of the two segments mentioned is omitted in the degenerate cases (zero point = 0,
   * no multiple used). Examples: 0 (!use_multiple, !non_zero_offset), 342342342+1024x0 (use_multiple, non_zero_offset),
   * 342342342+0 (!use_multiple, !non_zero_offset).
   *
   * The above is hair/formal, but try to correlate the examples in the 2 paragraphs to see how the practical output
   * makes some sense. */
