/**
 * Internal `net_flow` class that maintains the Drop Timer for DATA packet(s) to have been sent out
 * over a connection but not yet acknowledged by the receiver.  This is similar to the
 * Retransmission Timer of TCP (although the way that timer works is not solidly standardized,
 * though there are recommended setups in RFCs like RFC 6298).  However, this applies even with
 * retransmission disabled (which is allowed in NetFlow but not in TCP), so it would be incorrect to
 * call it `Rexmit_timer`; on the other hand when retransmission is enabled, Drop_timer will still be
 * an accurate name (as a packet has to be considered Dropped before we retransmit it).  `net_flow`
 * users should not use this class directly.
 *
 * The basic idea is: if you send a packet, and it's not acknowledged within some amount of time,
 * then consider that packet Dropped.  (At that point you can take it out of the In-flight window,
 * or retransmit it, or whatever else is appropriate.)  Beyond this concept the details are
 * ambiguous, and there is no one right/standard/accepted answer for how it should work. For
 * example, when to restart the timer?  What to do with the timer after it fires?  Etc.  Therefore
 * the class is reasonably configurable, so that we can experiment with different approaches.
 *
 * This class works together with Node, Peer_socket, and Server_socket and accordingly assumes
 * very specific algorithms are used in sending and handling acknowledgments.  However it
 * could pretty easily be swapped out with another implementationr
 *
 * A Drop_timer works as follows.  It keeps an internal timer that fires every DTO seconds, where
 * DTO is computed externally (from SRTT, etc.).  Certain events start or restart the timer (e.g.,
 * receiving an acknowledgment).  Other events stop the timer (namely having no more In-flight
 * packets).  Then when the timer fires, certain actions have to be taken, such as considering
 * packets Dropped and/or restarting the timer.  Additionally the DTO value itself can be written to
 * by Drop_timer (e.g., timer backoff).
 *
 * Therefore, the interface of Drop_timer is simple: you call `on_...()`, when a Drop
 * Timer-influencing event has occurred; and when some action needs to be taken due to a Drop Timer
 * firing, it calls a user-supplied callback which will perform that action.  The action callbacks
 * are supplied at construction.  Drop_timer internally takes care of everything in-between:
 * running/stopping the timer, catching the timer firing, etc.  All of the "policy" about how the
 * timer operates is also inside.  Calling done() means the socket is done, and no action callbacks
 * will subsequently fire.
 *
 * To schedule the timer, Drop_timer shares Node's main event queue (Node::m_task_engine).
 *
 * ### Thread safety ###
 * To be used in the containing Node's thread W only.
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 *
 * Having written this class, it looks over-engineered.  The code would be shorter (no `shared_ptr`,
 * callbacks, factory, `enable_shared_from_this`) if it were directly in Node and Peer_socket.  On the
 * other hand the Strategy Pattern setup used here is nice for segregating the Drop Timer logic and
 * for future modification, and it does make Node (which is huge) much easier to understand.  So could
 * go either way... rewrite in Node and Peer_socket or leave it alone.
 *
 * We use a `Ptr`-emitting factory, because wrapping the object in a `Ptr` helps with some internal
 * book-keeping and is useful to the user as well.
 *
 * ### Regarding events ###
 * You'll note the interface is extremely simple: essentially, outside code just registers whenever
 * packet becomes In-flight (a/k/a is sent over wire); and the opposite.  This simplicity comes at
 * an implementation cost, because it requires us to keep -- *internally* -- an ordered (by send time) set
 * of packets currently In-flight.  Why do this?  Because the true events we are interested in are slightly
 * more complex than what the Drop_timer API exposes: we want to detect when no packets are In-flight and
 * suddenly a packet is sent off; the reverse; the acknowledgment of a packet that is NOT the oldest
 * one currently In-flight; and the changing of the oldest currently In-flight packet from packet A to
 * packet B =/= A.  (That's as of this writing; perhaps this set of events could change.)
 *
 * One might wonder whether it would be -- overall -- simpler to just have the event API of Drop_timer (the set of
 * on_...() methods) just be those exact events I just listed.  Then outside code could just call them when detecting
 * those events.  After all, Peer_socket has complex structures keeping track all sorts of details including how
 * many and which packets are In-flight, so Peer_socket and Node code could easily detect all those situations.
 *
 * In fact, that IS how Drop_timer was implemented in the past.  Here is why I changed it: There is a small
 * caveat about what "In-flight" means.  Peer_socket's `m_snd_flying_pkts_...` data structures define "In-flight
 * packet" as "packet that has been determined to be fit to send over the wire, having passed the availability
 * and CWND constraints."  For Drop_timer's ideal operation, "In-flight packet" is defined as "packet that has
 * been sent over the wire."  The practical difference between the two definitions is that the former may be
 * awaiting certain send pacing conditions to actually be sent off; whereas the latter means it has been sent
 * off -- period.  (See `struct Send_pacing_data` and related code for info on pacing.  Essentially, though,
 * any packet that's definitely going to be sent out barring existential disaster may be delayed a bit in a pacing
 * queue to avoid bunching up packets in the pipe.)  However, we lack a data structure that specifically
 * stores packets to have been sent off over the wire, except indirectly in Peer_socket::m_snd_flying_pkts_by_sent_when
 * minus Send_pacing_data::m_packet_q.  The former is unwieldy for our purposes, let along when combined with the
 * other.  So it made more sense to just let outside code report truly In-flight packets appearing and disappearing
 * to us, then we store the (rather minimal) information internally.  Thus we separate concerns and divide
 * labor among modules in an accurate fashion instead of Drop_timer becoming ultra-dependent on other modules'
 * implementation details.  That said, there is probably some memory cost and (maybe) a little processor cycle
 * cost to this approach.  (One could also say that the pacing delay is so minor as to make it ignorable
 * here.  However, I decided I don't need the headache of wondering/worrying about that ad infinitum; and
 * solved the problem instead.)
 *
 * ### Update regarding events ###
 * In order to increase performance by smooshing together lots of little checks and
 * actions that might occur when handling lots of little events, namely received acknowledgments, the class
 * user must now bracket groups of `on_...()` method calls with start_contemporaneous_events() and
 * end_contemporaneous_events().  Thus each `on_...()` call performs only very basic/quick book-keeping; while
 * end_contemporaneous_events() is what compares the situation against what it was at start_contemporaneous_events()
 * and possibly detects the true events of interest that may actually trigger something (start timer, stop timer,
 * restart running timer).
 *
 * ### `Timer` vs util::schedule_task_from_now() ###
 * In other places we have tended to replace a `Timer` with the far simpler util::schedule_task_from_now() (etc.)
 * facility (which internally uses a `Timer` but hides its various annoyances and caveats).  Why not here?
 * Answer: We don't happen to use any of `Timer`'s advanced features that the simpler facility lacks; we just
 * schedule and cancel, and the other facility supports those.  So that just leaves the potential performance
 * effects as the reason not to use the simpler facility (as listed in util::schedule_task_from_now() doc header).
 * The logic concerning the delay before each scheduled task, and how often it might be canceled and/or
 * rescheduled is not simple.  It's hard to make iron-clad guarantees, therefore, that using a single repeatedly-reused
 * `Timer` is no better perf-wise than using multiple schedulings using the simpler facility.  So we do the
 * perf-conservative thing and use `Timer` despite having to worry about a couple of the associated corner cases.
 *
 * Or to put it concisely: The timer logic here is complicated, so the perf and flexibility aspects of directly using
 * the advanced `Timer` feature are suitable.
 *
 * @todo Drop_timer has data members that are references to non-`const`.  These should be pointers for max consistency
 * of style with other code in the project (and that style is encouraged for certain good reasons).  Scour rest of
 * code for other such data members as well.
