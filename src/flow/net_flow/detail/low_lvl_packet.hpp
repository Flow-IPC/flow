/**
 * Internal `net_flow` `struct` that encapsulates the Flow-protocol low-level packet structure and serves as
 * the super-type for all specific packet types, represented by derived `struct`s like Ack_packet, Rst_packet,
 * etc.
 *
 * This `struct` and its sub-`struct` hierarchy are not too complex but nevertheless are somewhat unorthodox,
 * combining a few different paradigms.  So it's worth explaining these paradigms.
 *
 * ### Paradigm: Data store ###
 * This is a `struct` holding the conceptual contents of a packet.  Low_lvl_packet stores common values like
 * #m_opt_rexmit_on, #m_src_port, and a few more.  Each sub-`struct` stores further values specific to each
 * packet type; for example, as of this writing, Data_packet::m_data contains the data payload of a DATA
 * packet; this would not apply, for example, to another sub-`struct` like Rst_packet, because an RST stores
 * no binary blob like that.
 *
 * Since it's a simple data store, the applicable data members (in this `struct` and the sub-types) are
 * both public AND non-`const`.  They can be read and written at will, thus changing or reading the
 * logical contents of the packet.
 *
 * ### Paradigm: Polymorphic type ###
 * While a simple data store, it also represents a hierarchy of possible packet types, and indeed a number
 * of important polymorphic operations are included.  Some are private/internal, and some are public.
 * A public method may not appear polymorphic by its signature, but in that case usually its implementation
 * uses non-public `virtual` methods to accomplish its tasks.  Specifically, the key APIs are:
 *
 *   - `create_uninit_packet<T>()`: This creates an uninitialized sub-object of Low_lvl_packet, of actual
 *     type `T`, where `T` derives from Low_lvl_packet.  This returns a `shared_ptr<T>`, and any actual
 *     constructor used to implement this factory method is non-public, so the only way for a user to
 *     create a Low_lvl_packet is to get at a ref-counted pointer to it -- not a raw, unprotected pointer.  If storing
 *     only `shared_ptr<T>` or `Ptr` values, deletion is not something to worry about, as it will happen
 *     automatically.
 *     - Same with the other factory methods described just below.  Direct access to `Low_lvl_packet*` or
 *       `T*`, where `T` derives from Low_lvl_packet, is not allowed (but this is not enforced at compile time
 *       and, at best, via `assert()`s at runtime).
 *   - create_from_raw_data_packet(): Given a raw serialized packet, this factory method constructs
 *     a Low_lvl_packet of the appropriate polymorphic sub-type, filling it at all levels with the data
 *     deserialized for the input binary blob.  Internally, it uses some private, `virtual` action to get this
 *     to work.  At any rate, this method is used to crete a logical representation of a packet off the wire.
 *   - serialize_to_raw_data(): The opposite operation: convert existing object to raw data sendable over the wire.
 *     This uses a high-performance scatter-gather paradigm of producing a sequence of pointers and lengths to
 *     already existing data areas, avoiding copying.  This thing is `virtual` and applies to any Low_lvl_packet
 *     sub-object.
 *
 * (Reminder: As with all polymorphism and `shared_ptr`, you may need `static_pointer_cast<>` to up- and down-cast
 * between Low_lvl_packet and subclasses.  Also `Low_lvl_packet::ptr_cast()` up-casts even syntactically-sugarier-ly.)
 *
 * The two basic flows are:
 *   - Call `create_uninit_packet<T>()` to construct a sub-`struct` of Low_lvl_packet, returned as a ref-counted
 *     pointer to `T`.  Fill out all the fields manually, accessing object via aforemetioned smart pointer.
 *     Call serialize_to_raw_data().  Pass result of latter to a boost.asio network-sending routine
 *     to send over wire.  Ensure you pass a `Ptr` to the completion handler passed to that routine, so that
 *     the Low_lvl_packet survives while being sent.  The handler can let the `Ptr` go out of scope, likely
 *     `delete`ing the Low_lvl_packet.
 *   - Receive raw packet over wire.  Call create_from_raw_data_packet() to yield a Low_lvl_packet::Ptr pointing
 *     to new Low_lvl_packet sub-object with all fields filled out.  Read the fields as needed to process the
 *     packet; store the `Ptr` if necessary; eventually removing it from all data structures will drop ref-count
 *     to zero, and it will be auto-`delete`d.
 *
 * ### Other utlities ###
 * A number of (typically polymorphic) facilities exist, mainly to log these objects to `ostream`s, including
 * when logging with FLOW_LOG_TRACE() and FLOW_LOG_DATA().
 *
 *   - #m_verbose_ostream_manip and #m_concise_ostream_manip are `const` data members that can be output
 *     via the usual `<<` operator to `ostream`s in order to output verbose and concise descriptions
 *     of any Low_lvl_packet (of any sub-`struct` type, polymorphically).
 *   - #m_type_ostream_manip can be similarly used to output just the packet type of any given
 *     Low_lvl_packet (producing strings like `"ACK"` or `"RST"`).
 *
 * The implementation of these is typically some polymorphic `virtual` magic, but the use is straightforward using
 * these `ostream` manipulator data members.
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 *
 * ### History of approaches ###
 * Originally the implementation used the boost.serialization library for packet serialization, but
 * it turned out to consume way too much CPU time which consequently limited the maximum
 * throughput at high speeds.  The next implementation used the traditional approach based on
 * "packed" structures (structures without any padding), in one big `struct Low_lvl_packet`.
 * However, I deemed the latter setup too C-like (yet simultaneously
 * not C-like enough, in that no unions were used, hence RAM was wasted despite the C-like approach).
 * Ultimately, the current version of the implementation came about, with its polymorphic `struct` hierarchy
 * and abstract Low_lvl_packet `struct` (which, in the previous iteration, simply contained everything
 * about every type, complete with an `enum Type` instead of using C++'s built-in `typeid`, as the current
 * version uses).
 *
 * While the above evolution was more about coding style philosophy (from a single type and a type selector
 * `enum` to a polymorphic hierarchy and `typeid`), the other evolution concerned the way serialization
 * (for sending over the write) worked.  At first, as mentioned, there were the logical values (which were
 * public and non-`const`), and there were private packed `struct`s into which the logical values were
 * placed (with transformation for endianness and other things) at serialization time; finally then assembling
 * a newly allocated single binary buffer, those packed `struct`s copied into it.  Not bad -- rather verbose
 * having all those types defined, but not bad -- but it did involve a new buffer and linear-time copying into
 * that buffer.  This seemed like a shame.
 *
 * This led to the final improvement, which was to turn the serialization function into one that generates
 * a `boost::asio::const_buffer_sequence`, basically a sequence of pointers and associated lengths of areas
 * already present in memory.  In most cases (with a couple small exceptions), the stored public data members
 * (e.g., #m_src_port and Data_packet::m_data) could simply have their addresses and lengths taken and placed
 * into the `const_buffer_sequence` -- no buffer copying involved.  This should achieve a nice performance
 * improvement.  The removal of things like `struct Common_header` and `struct Ack_header` is a good bonus
 * coding-wise, too.
 *
 * (There is a caveat there.  While no issue for the true performance culprits, namely Data_packet::m_data,
 * the various multi-byte integer values like #m_src_port technically have to undergo endianness conversion
 * during serialization.  So technically simply taking an address and size is not enough; the value needs
 * to be flipped *potentially*.  In reality, though, all relevant architectures are such that we chose
 * identical network byte order as memory byte order, making no flipping necessary in practice.  Of course,
 * if we spread to an architecture where this is not true, everything will explode.  However, a compile-time
 * assertion would warn us of this, and a nearby comment will instruct on how to deal with the problem, in the
 * unlikely case it were to appear.  [Little-endian is rather universal these days.])
 *
 * ### Packed structures, stored integers, and alignment ###
 * When 2 or more contiguous data members are used in serializing (serialize_to_raw_data() or overridden
 * version), they are packed together via `"#pragma pack"`.  Since this is done in isolated places that don't
 * comprise entire `struct`s, it would have been nice to apply this `"#pragma"` just to those fields, but it
 * does not seem to work.  Due to the way these little pairs, etc., of members are sprinkled about the
 * whole hierarchy, I just put one giant packing `"#pragma"` around the whole hierarchy.  This might slightly
 * decrease caching performance due to misalignment of various fields, including ones unrelated to serialization,
 * but I doubt it's really tangible -- and the code is a whole lot simpler than it would be otherwise.
 *
 * Numeric values are stored as unsigned integers, which is the most portable choice for serializing.
 * Booleans are serialized as bytes for compactness.
 *
 * Some effort is made to keep fields aligned along word edges when serializing.  There is not too much
 * of that as of this writing, but we should remain vigilant as packet formats become more complex over time.
 *
 * @todo With C++11, some lines of code could be eliminated by using `using` for Low_lvl_packet sub-types
 * to inherit the constructor(s) of Low_lvl_packet.  (For some of the sub-types an explicit constructor
 * would still be necessary, but it would just shadow the inherited one, which is fine and still saves lines
 * in the other sub-types.)  However, for now I've left it as-is, partially to be friendly to the Doxygen
 * documentation generator, and partially to make the interface easy to read.  Still, it may be better the other
 * way.

   * ### Implementation note ###
   * An alternative way to implement this mechanism (as of this writing, raw type IDs and brief
   * string descriptions per packet type) is to use `virtual` liberally, combined with a `switch` if needed.  (Note,
   * also, that a way to index -- such as in an `unordered` container -- by
   * packet type is necessary elsewhere.  We use `type_index(typeid()))` now, but a [worse] alternative is to have
   * `virtual` type IDs returned for each Low_lvl_packet sub-type.)  I could explain
   * at length all the reasons why the chosen way is superior, but let me just give you the conclusion: I originally
   * tried it the `virtual/switch` way.  Instead of the raw type IDs and
   * string descriptions being conveniently encapsulated in the present map (where there's little to no chance of
   * conflicting values), they were distributed across `virtual` implementations.  This was less maintainable; nor did
   * it improve OO style, since the raw type ID values (at least) were
   * still inter-dependent (were not allowed to conflict) in any case.
   * The present solution does not pretend the actual contents of these values are of no interest to Low_lvl_packet
   * itself (as opposed to the sub-types), and in not having to pretend this, all related code is quite a bit more
   * compact and a bit more maintainable as well.

   * An earlier version of `net_flow` used the unit milliseconds and the encoding type uint16_t.  The
   * reasoning was that this allowed a maximum ACK delay of ~65 sec which should be plenty; and that
   * the 1-millisecond finegrainedness was acceptable.  However when implementing queue delay-based
   * congestion control (like FAST or Vegas) we realized it is important for RTTs (which use the ACK
   * delay value) to be quite precise (microsecond level or so).  Therefore, to be totally safe, we
   * choose to use the same units as #Fine_duration, which is how we compute all time periods.  As
   * for the the encoding width, we use 64 bits just in case.
   *
   * @todo Reconsider the encoding width.  If `Ack_delay_time_unit(1)` is a nanosecond, then 32 bits
   * would support a maximum delay of ~4.1 seconds which is likely fine for most real-world
   * scenarios.  This would reduce the size of ACK packets quite a bit.

   * provided by the other side and ordered in the chronological order they were received.
   * This may also be empty, in which case the containing ACK acknowledges no DATA packets but only
   * advertises the current receive window size (#m_rcv_wnd).  (Note that it advertises it if
   * #m_rcv_acked_packets is NOT empty as well.)
   *
   * This is used if and only if this Ack_packet is incoming.  See #m_rcv_acked_packets_rexmit_on_out
   * and #m_rcv_acked_packets_rexmit_off_out for the outgoing scenario.
   *
   * Unlike vanilla TCP from RFC 793, which features cumulative acknowledgment (wherein only the
   * latest received segment BEFORE any unreceived gap is acknowledged, thus just one total number
   * in the ACK), and unlike later enhanced TCPs, which feature both cumulative acknowledgement
   * and individual ACKs (Selective ACKs), we use something similar to Selective ACKs only.  That
   * is, we only acknowledge each packet individually (though we combine many such little
   * acknowledgments into one packet via delayed ACKs).  Moreover, we do not piggy-back ACK info
   * onto DATA packets; ACK is its own type.
   *
   * Rationale for using SACKs only: Selective ACKs help greatly in giving accurate congestion
   * control data (e.g., ACK delay per packet, dropped packets) and remove complex ambiguities of
   * trying to interpret cumulative ACKs for that purpose.  For retransmits, when enabled, Selective
   * ACKs also greatly simplify the design choices (since we know exactly what they don't have
   * [assuming no lost ACKs], we can send exactly what they want and no more).
   *
   * Rationale for keeping ACK and DATA separate: This is less clear-cut.  It is easier to think
   * about, certainly, as the two types of traffic aren't really logically related in a full-duplex
   * connection.  On the other hand it increases overhead.  On the third hand that disadvantage is
   * not a big deal assuming mostly unidirectional traffic flow (which is typical), since most of
   * the time the ACKs would be data-less anyway in that situation.  Delayed ACKs also help combat
   * overhead -- somewhat.
   *
   * Rationale for delayed ACKs a/k/a accumulating more than 1 acknowledgment into an ACK: Combat
   * overhead which can be a big deal for high bitrate streaming traffic for example (research
   * shows ACK flow can be 10% of data flow in the other direction).  The cost is that the other
   * side gets somewhat delayed congestion control information, but the delay can be tuned.  In
   * TCP implementations delayed ACKs appear to be universal since a long time ago.
   *
   * Any two packets represented by these `Individual_ack`s may be duplicates of each other (same
   * Sequence_number, possibly different delay values).  It's up to the sender (receiver of ACK)
   * to sort it out.  However, again, they MUST be ordered chronologicaly based on the time when
   * they were received; from earliest to latest.
   *
   * Storing shared pointers to avoid copying of `struct`s (however small) during internal
   * reshuffling; shared instead of raw pointers to not worry about `delete`.
