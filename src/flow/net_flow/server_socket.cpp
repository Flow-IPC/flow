   *   -3- Save serv in m_servs.
   *   (Both -1- and -3- can result in error.)
   *
   * -2- must be done in thread W, as m_servs is by design only to be accessed there.  -1-, however,
   * can be done in thread U, assuming m_ports is properly synchronized.  So here are our choices:
   *
   * I. Perform -1- in U.  If error, return.  Perform -2-.  Post callback to do -3- in W.  Return
   *    serv in U.  Meanwhile -2- will, at some point, be performed in W.  If error in -3-, save it
   *    in serv.  User will discover when trying to serv->accept().
   *
   * II. Perform -1- in U.  If error, return.  Perform -2-.  Post callback to do -3- in W.  Use a
   *     future/promise pair to wait for -3- to complete.  Meanwhile -3- will, at some point, be performed
   *     in W.  If error in -3-, save it in serv.  Either way, U will wait for the result and return
   *     error or serv to the user.
   *
   * III. Post callback to do -1-, -2-, -3- in W.  Use a future/promise pair to wait for -1-3- to complete.
   *      Meanwhile -1-3- will, at some point, be performed in W.  If error in -1-3-, save it in
   *      serv.  Either way, U will wait.  If error, return error to the user.  Else return serv to
   *      the user.
   *
   * Let's pick one.  III > II due to simpler code; future used either way but most code is in one
   * thread and one function (the W callback); the U part is a short wrapper.  Also, Port_space need
   * not be synchronized.  So it's I vs. III.  Advantage of I is speed; listen() will return in U
   * faster, especially if thread W is loaded with work.  (However III is still non-blocking, i.e.,
   * no waiting for network events.)  Advantage of III is simplicity of code (everything in one
   * thread and callback, in W; no explicit locking); and any pre-networking error is immediately
   * returned by listen() instead of being discovered later.  I believe here III wins, especially
   * because listen() should be fairly infrequent, so a split second speed difference should not be
   * significant.
   *
   * So we choose III.  We set up connect_worker() to run in W and wait for
   * it to succeed or fail.  asio_exec_ctx_post() does the promise/future stuff, or equivalent, so
   * the code is really simple. */

   * not itself acknowledged in our scheme).  Another possibility is they sent both, but then DATA
   * got re-ordered to in front of SYN_ACK_ACK.
   *
   * What does TCP do here?  Well, it doesn't really have this problem, because every segment must
   * have an ACK in it.  So if a TCP gets data in SYN_RCVD, it must also contain the ACK to the
   * SYN_ACK (what we call SYN_ACK_ACK) (in TCP, any packet without ACK is simply considered
   * corrupt/invalid and would not be sent in the first place).  So it's impossible to send data
   * without acknowledging the SYN_ACK at the same time.
   *
   * For us, however ACK packets are independent of DATA packets, as are SYN_ACK_ACK packets.
   * Therefore we should either drop these DATAs and hope whatever reliability implementation is
   * used restores them later, or we should queue them for consumption when ESTABLISHED arrives.
   * Let's do the latter.  It's hard enough to deal with actual loss; introducing loss when we
   * actually have the stuff seems absurd.
   *
   * So we just save them in a packet queue, and when we're ESTABLISHED we feed all the packets to
   * handle_incoming() as if they'd just arrived.  The only caveat is size of this queue.  Since
   * we have a maximum on the Receive buffer (sock->m_rcv_buf) and the packets-with-gaps structure
   * (sock->m_rcv_packets_with_gaps), we must have one here as well.  Since Receive buffer is
   * empty until ESTABLISHED, it seems natural to limit this queue's cumulative byte size
   * according to the limit imposed on Receive buffer.  (There is some extra overhead to store the
   * packet header info, but it's close enough.)  After that, as when the Receive buffer fills up,
