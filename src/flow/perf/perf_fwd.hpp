 * Constructs a closure that times and executes `void`-returning `function()`, adding the elapsed time with

 *
 * Consider other overload(s) and similarly named functions as well.  With this one you get:
 *   - `function()` is treated as returning `void` (any return value is ignored).
 *   - `function()` is a generally-used timed function: not necessarily a `boost.asio` or flow::async *handler*.
 *     Any associated executor (such as a `strand`) *will* be lost.  See timed_handler(), if you have a handler.
 *   - One specific perf::Clock_type, not some subset given as perf::Clock_types_subset.  For performance this may
 *     be significant, even though operations on the latter are still light-weight.
 *   - Accumulation (the plus-equals operation) done by performing `+=(duration_rep_t)`, where perf::duration_rep_t
 *     is -- as a reminder -- a raw integer type like `int64_t`.  If accumulation may occur in a multi-threaded
 *     situation concurrently, this can improve performance vs. using an explicit lock, if one
 *     uses `Accumulator` = `atomic<duration_rep_t>`.
 *   - Lack of `chrono`-style type safety: It is up to you to interpret the `*accumulator`-stored ticks as their
 *     appropriate units.

 *
 * ### `Accumulator A` type requirements/recommendations ###
 * It must have `A += duration_rep_t(...)`.  This operation must be safe for concurrent execution with itself, if
 * timed_function() is potentially used concurrently.  In that case consider `atomic<duration_rep_t>`.  If concurrency
 * is not a concern, you can just use `duration_rep_t` to avoid the strict-ordering overhead involved in `atomic`
 * plus-equals operation.
 *
 * `Accumulator` is understood to store raw ticks of #Duration -- not actual #Duration -- for performance reasons
 * (to wit: so that `atomic` plus-equals can be made use of, if it exists).  If you need a #Duration
 * ultimately -- and for type safety you really *should* -- it is up to you to construct a #Duration from the
 * accumulated `duration_rep_t`.  This is trivially done via the `Duration(duration_rep_t)` constructor.
 *
 * @todo timed_function(), when operating on an `atomic<duration_rep_t>`, uses `+=` for accumulation which may be
 * lock-free but uses strict ordering; a version that uses `fetch_add()` with relaxed ordering may be desirable
 * for extra performance at the cost of not-always-up-to-date accumulation results in all threads.
 * As of this writing this can be done by the user by providing a custom type that defines `+=` as explicitly
 * using `fetch_add()` with relaxed ordering; but we could provide an API for this.
 *
 * @todo timed_function() overload exists for a single `Clock_type`, but simultaneous multi-clock timing using the
 * perf::Clock_types_subset paradigm (as used, e.g., in Checkpointing_timer) would be a useful and consistent API.
 * E.g., one could measure user and system elapsed time simultaneously.  As of this writing this only does not exist
 * due to time constraints: a perf-niggardly version targeting one clock type was necessary.
 *
 * @tparam Accumulator
 *         Integral accumulator of clock ticks.  See above for details.
 * @tparam Func
 *         A function that is called `void`-style taking any arbitrary number of args, possibly none.
 * @param clock_type
 *        The type of clock to use for timing `function()`.
 * @param accumulator
 *        The accumulator to add time elapsed when calling `function()` to.  See instructions above regarding
 *        concurrency, `atomic`, etc.

 *        The function to execute and time.
 * @return A closure that will time and execute `function()`, adding the elapsed time to `accumulator`.

/**
 * Identical to timed_function() but suitable for boost.asio-targeted handler functions.  In other words, if you want
 * to `post(handler)` or `async_...(handler)` in a boost.asio `Task_engine`, and you'd like to time `handler()` when
 * it is executed by boost.asio, then use `timed_handler(..., handler)`.
 *
 * Consider other overload(s) and similarly named functions as well.  With this one you get:

 *   - Otherwise identical to the similar timed_function().
 *
 * @note This is suitable for using the Flow-recommended boost.asio wrapper/helper API, flow::async.
 * @warning Using `timed_function(handler)` would "work" too, in that it would compile and at a first glance appear to
 *          work fine.  The problem: If `handler` is bound to an executor -- most commonly a boost.asio strand
 *          (util::Strand) -- then using timed_function() would "unbind it."  So it it was bound to `Strand S`, meant
 *          to make certain `handler()` never executed concurrently with other handlers bound to `S`, then that
 *          constraint would (silently!) no longer be observed -- leading to terrible intermittent concurrency bugs.
 * @note boost.asio handlers always return `void` (meaning anything else they might return is ignored).  Hence there is
