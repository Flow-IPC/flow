/**
 * Internally used class that enables some of the activities of beautify_chrono_ostream() API.  It's a locale facet,
 * whose `virtual` API can be used to imbue onto an `ostream`;
 * but even within our own internal code the only public API used is beautified_locale(), which
 * returns a reference to a ready-made such `std::locale`.
 *
 * This facet enables the default `chrono` output behavior, except the "micro" short-form prefix
 * is just "u" instead of the default Unicode Greek letter mu.
 *
 * ### Implementation notes ###
 * How it does this is fairly self-explanatory, but finding out how to do it was annoyingly tricky due to the
 * inconsistent/outdated boost.chrono docs which only partially explain boost.chrono I/O v2.  Ultimately I had to
 * find the actual example `french.cpp` (not its outdated v1 version directly inside the main doc text, in Boost 1.76);
 * then cross-reference it with the Reference section that described the `duration_units_default` class.

   * Returns a reference to a locale that -- if imbued onto an `ostream` --

   * ### Thread safety and perf ###
   * This (`static`) method is safe to call concurrently with itself.  Internally it achieves this possibly by using a
   * simple mutex.  Since it is not expected one would call this frequently, let alone frequently enough for any
   * contention to occur, we consider this acceptable.

   *
   * ### Rationale ###
   * This is `public` only so as to work as a `virtual` facet interface element invoked by STL `ostream` machinery upon
   * imbuing `*this` onto a `locale`.  Since Duration_units_beautified is not exposed as a flow::util public API,
   * leaving this method `public` (to our internal code in this .cpp file only) is acceptable.
