/**
 * @namespace flow::util::bind_ns
 *
 * @brief Hack namespace alias to enable use of `bind` and related utilities like `cref` in the face of strange observed
 * compiler behavior.
 *
 * The code in the past used `bind` and its helpers `cref` and `ref` fairly extensively.  (Vast majority of `bind`s are
 * now replaced with superior uses of lambdas, with the upgrade to C++1x.  So it's far less extensive than in past.)
 * However, there is something odd going on with namespace resolution for
 * these guys.  At least in the clang version used as of this writing, `bind` somehow
 * works without qualification, as does `cref` (and thus probably `ref`); I really don't know why.  I'd like to use
 * the `boost::` versions, though, specifically (for stylistic reasons explained elsewhere).  More importantly, I don't
 * want to use something that mysteriously works without qualification -- is `std::` somehow being forced with some
 * phantom `using namespace` from some evil header somewhere?  I am not sure as of this writing.  In any case,
 * this allows one to just say `using util::bind_ns::bind` and then use `bind()` without qualification in that
 * block (typically function/method) without worrying that some weird unqualified guy will be used.
 *
 * Caveat 1: I don't know why, but in the aforementioned clang, `using util::bind_ns::cref` makes `cref()` become
 * ambiguous with some `std::cref`; it's quite unclear why the same complaint then doesn't happen for `bind()` itself.
 * In that case, when an error is encountered, get rid of the `using` and instead qualify it as `util::bind_ns::cref()`.
 * It sucks, but at least it's clear.
 *
 * Caveat 2: I haven't built in MS Visual Studio in quite a while (though it did use to work at one point), but back
 * then I remember some VC++-specific trouble with `bind()` resolution.  Possibly it's related to the above.
 * Anyway, use `bind_ns` as needed to get around any such compile errors.
 *
 * Note: Knowing of this phantom `bind()` that's magically available sans qualification, I also tried to use
 * unqualified `cout` and `endl` in the same context but thankfully got the expected errors in clang saying
 * these identifiers do not exist but suggesting the use of `std::cout` and `std::endl`.  So, at least it's not
 * all of `std` being forced on the code.
 *
 * @todo Investigate deeply the cause of the strange behavior with unqualified `bind()` and others described
 * above this line in the source code.

/**
 * Helper for FLOW_UTIL_WHERE_AM_I() that, given a pointer/length of a string in memory containing a path, returns
 * a pointer/length into that same buffer that comprises the postfix
 * just past the last directory separator or (if none exists) to all of it.
 *
 * ### Rationale for taking and returning #String_view this way ###
 * There are 2 other alternatives.  One is essentially to take `std::string` (or #String_view) and return new
 * `std::string` (or some variation).  That is un-great, because the main use case is to use this at log call sites,
 * and creating temporary `std::string`s is best avoided; the ability to simply return a pointer into existing memory,
 * -- particularly since it is likely to come from `__FILE__` (which is in static memory) -- might represent
 * significant perf savings.  So that leaves either the alternative we chose or a variation (which, historically, used
 * to be the case) which is to take a `const char*` and return same, into that memory.  The latter is an acceptable
 * approach.  #String_view, by comparison, does involve storing an extra bit of data, namely the length stored inside
 * #String_view.  We stipulate this is negligible in terms of RAM and copying costs when compared to doing same with
 * the pointers alone... but what's the advantage?  Answer: it may be small; but in order to search for the right-most
 * dir separator character, one needs to internally find the NUL (a/k/a `strlen()`); with #String_view it is already
 * available, so the linear search is unnecessary.  Doesn't it cost cycles to set the length though? you ask.
 * Answer: Not if one constructs the `#String_view`s involved cleverly.  To wit:
 *
 * ### Instructions on how to best construct `String_view path` from `__FILE__` ###
 * For max performance, do it in the same way as recommended when setting log::Msg_metadata::m_msg_src_file.
 * Spoiler alert: Use `sizeof(__FILE__)` to obtain a compile-time length.
 *
 * ### `constexpr` ###
 * Update: This function is now `constexpr`, so `path` must be known at compile-time; hence the above instructions
 * (while still valid) apply in a different way.  The raw performance doesn't necessarily matter (since it's "executed"
 * by the compiler now).  However, following those instructions (1) will help make `constexpr`ness easier to achieve
 * (as the NUL-terminated #String_view ctor is less likely to be effectively `constexpr` depending on compiler; while
 * the pointer+length ctor is more likely so); and (2) is good for perf in case `constexpr`ness is
 * dropped in the future.  It's less fragile is the point.  Anyway, just do it!
 *
 * @param path
 *        String containing a path from a `__FILE__` macro.  See instructions above for max perf.
 * @return See above.

 * For rationale of using #String_view instead of `const char*` for the string args see similar reasoning in
