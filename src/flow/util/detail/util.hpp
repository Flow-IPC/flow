 * itself.

 * ### Perf instructions ###
 * For best perf results: for all `ARG_...` that you pass in as flow::util::String_view please follow instructions in
 * doc header of log::Msg_metadata::m_msg_src_file and log::Msg_metadata::m_msg_src_function.
 *
 * @param ARG_file
 *        Full file name, as from `__FILE__`, as a `String_view`; or a fragment inside it (e.g., just the
 *        part past the last dir separator if any); depending on which part you'd prefer ultimately printed.
 * @param ARG_function
 *        Full function name, as from `__FUNCTION__`, as a `String_view` (recommended for perf) or `const char*`.
 * @param ARG_line
 *        Line number, as from `__LINE__`.
 * @return `ostream` fragment `X` (suitable for, for example: `std::cout << X << ": Hi!"`).

/**
 * Helper macro: like FLOW_UTIL_WHERE_AM_I(), with a major relative strength -- its replacement is a string literal --
 * and two differences: the function name must be supplied verbatim as an arg; and the source file name
 * will contain the entire path as opposed to a massaged version with just the file-name component.
 * The key is that the function name arg is not to be a string: it is *stringified* to get the string.
 *
 * Nevertheless, in perf-sensitive scenarios, this may well be worth it.  For now we keep it in a detail/ header
 * for use internally to Flow; we did in fact need this in flow::error.
 *
 * Other than the aforementioned difference and mild formatting tweaks for cosmetics (as of this writing an added
 * space), the format of the replacement's contents is identical to that from FLOW_UTIL_WHERE_AM_I().
 *
 * ### Rationale ###
 * Why need `ARG_function`?  Why not simply use `__FUNCTION__` internally?  Answer: Despite its similar look
 * to `__FILE__`, actually `__FUNCTION__` is *not* a macro: it is an identifier (that refers to a `const char*`).
 * The preprocessor knows what file (and line) it's scanning; but it has no idea what func it's scanning;
 * that's only known at a later stage of compilation.  So long story short: `__FUNCTION__` is not replaced
 * by a string literal and thus cannot be used to compose a string literal by compile-time concatenation.
 *
 * (`constexpr` sweetness can be used for an otherwise compile-time-determined value; but we promised a literal
 * here.  `constexpr`ness is outside our scope.  Though perhaps see FLOW_UTIL_WHERE_AM_I_FROM_ARGS() for that.)
 *
 * @param ARG_function
 *        Informally this is something akin to `ARG_function` to FLOW_ERROR_EXEC_AND_THROW_ON_ERROR().
 *        Formally this can be anything; it will be stringified via `#ARG_function` and output as the function name.
 *        (Do not attempt to pass here the name of a string-typed variable; that probably won't do
 *        what you want.  E.g., if you invoke `FLOW_UTIL_WHERE_AM_I_LITERAL(func_name)`, and `func_name`
 *        is an `std::string` with a function name, then the macro replacement will be
 *        `"/some/file.cpp:func_name(332)"` --
 *        without `func_name` getting replaced by the contents of your `func_name` variable or whatever.)
 * @return A string literal containing file name (and path; from `__FILE__`), function name given, and
 *         line number (from `__LINE__`).
 *         The string literal will be in the form `"stuff" "more stuff" "more stuff"` (etc.).  There will be
 *         no surrounding parentheses (in case you want to compile-time-concatenate to even more literal segments).
