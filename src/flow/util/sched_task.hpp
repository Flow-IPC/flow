  // See schedule_task_from_now() doc header for philosophical intro to what we are doing here: the context. Then read:

  const auto task_id = Unique_id_holder::create_unique_id();

  /* Shove all the state here, which is a ref-counted pointer around this simple struct.
   * Because we copy that ref-counted pointer into any lambda/closure we schedule, the state -- including the Timer
   * itself! -- will continue existing until none of *our* code needs it, at which point ref-count=0, and it is all
   * destroyed automatically.
   *
   * In addition, though, we return (in opaque fashion) a copy of this pointer in the return value of the present
   * function.  The life-time can thus be extended by the user (not that they need to worry about that internal
   * detail).  This is all trivially safe -- it exists until it doesn't need to, automatically -- but is there a
   * potential for wasted memory?  Answer: Not really; in addition to the struct being fairly light-weight, there's no
   * reason for user to keep a copy of this handle once the task has fired, or they've had to cancel it.
   *
   * ### IMPORTANT SUBTLETY REGARDING THE SAVED LAMBDA IN task->m_body (LAST ARG TO CTOR) ###
   * Why save a wrapper function around task_body_moved (could just set m_body = task_body_moved), and
   * why not just execute m_body(<true or false>) synchronously from within the async_wait() handler below or
   * the handler post()ed by scheduled_task_short_fire(), and moreover why the strange-looking
   * get_associated_executor()/bind_executor() thing (could just post() task_body)?  Answer:
   *
   * For that matter, every other API as of this writing seems to take a concrete type, a Function<>, for callbacks --
   * avoiding templates -- but we take a template-param-typed arg.  Why?  Answer(s):
   *
   * schedule_task_from_now() is, essentially, a boost.asio extension that is akin to its various async_*() methods
   * and free functions (like Timer::async_wait() itself), in that it takes a completion handler to execute async later.
   * As such there is the expectation that, if it's associated with a `strand`, it will execute from within that strand
   * (meaning non-concurrently with any other handlers also so-associated).  (More generally, a strand is an "executor",
   * and one expects it to be executed through that "executor."  See boost.asio docs, not that they're super-readable,
   * especially the link below.)
   *
   * Long story short, if they pass in X = boost::asio::bind_executor(some_strand, some_func), where some_func()
   * takes 1+ args, then to execute it on *task_engine we must do post(*task_engine, F), where F() takes no args
   * and invokes X(args...) in its { body }.  An easy mistake, and bug, is to simply call X(args...).
   * Per https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/core/strands.html
   * and https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/post.html, post(*task_engine, F) picks up
   * the association with some_strand via get_associated_executor() machinery, internally.  If we simply call
   * X(args...), then that association is ignored.  Therefore, when we post the wrapper F(), we have to associate F()
   * with some_strand.  This has 2 implications:
   *   - We have to post() the wrapper around X(), and we must re-bind that wrapper with X()'s associated executor.
   *     This is done via bind_executor(get_associated_executor(X), F).
   *   - Even more subtly, if we took task_body_moved as a Function<> (Scheduled_task) and not a template arg
   *     Scheduled_task_handler, then their X will be beautifully auto-converted into a wrapping Function<>()...
   *     thus making get_associated_executor(Function<>(X)) return the default thing, and not some_strand.
   *     Hence we must carefully take their *actual* function object of indeterminate type, and extract the
   *     associated executor from *that*, not from Function<>(X).
   *
   * The rest flows from that.  We post() a very simple wrapper (with a bit of logging) through the same executor
   * (if any; if it's the default one then it still works) as the handler object they passed in.  I (ygoldfel) have
   * written so much text only because this is an easy mistake to make, and I have made it, causing a bug: it still
   * compiles and works... but not through the strand.  Tip: To directly check whether it worked,
   * `some_strand.running_in_this_thread()` must return true inside some_func().  Beats trying to force a thread-unsafe
   * situation and try to be satisfied when it doesn't occur (which is luck-based).
   *
   * P.S. I have verified, both in theory and in practice, that
   * `post(some_task_engine, bind_executor(get_associated_executor(F), F)` still executes through some_task_engine,
   * even when F is a vanilla lambda/function and not associated with any strand.  The theoretical reason it works
   * can be found in the post() doc link above, where it explains how precisely it invokes F() (both
   * some_task_engine, itself an executor, and g_a_e(F) are involved -- it works out; details omitted here).
   * The reason one might worry is that g_a_e(F), where F is non-strandy/vanilla, yields system_executor, which -- if
   * post()ed onto *directly* -- uses some unspecified thread/pool.  But together with post(some_task_engine),
   * it does work.
   *
   * P.P.S. Why not execute the async_wait()'s completion handler below through g_a_e(task_body_moved)?  1, we have
   * our own algorithm for avoiding thread-unsafety and want to use *task_engine directly; it is less entropy-laden
   * to apply task_body_moved's associated executor only to task_body_moved itself (plus a bit of bracketing logging).
   * Whatever executor they associated task_body_moved with -- perhaps a strand, or something else -- has unknown
   * properties, and we have our own algorithm.
   * 2, then scheduled_task_short_fire() can just reuse task->m_body which already takes care of the
   * properly-executor-associated post()ing of task_body_moved.
