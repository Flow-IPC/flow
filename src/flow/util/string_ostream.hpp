/**
 * Similar to `ostringstream` but allows fast read-only access directly into the `std::string` being written;
 * and some limited write access to that string.  Also it can take over an existing `std::string`.
 *
 * `ostringstream` is fine, except for the giant flaw that is the fact that the essentially only way to read the string
 * is to call `ostringstream::str()` which returns a copy, not a reference.
 *
 * @todo Consider using `alt_sstream` in boost.format; it doesn't seem to have public documentation but isn't in
 * a `detail` directory either.  So that's interesting.  It might have better performance than the implementation
 * here (by being more "direct" probably).  Then again it might not.
 *
 * ### Thread safety ###
 * This provides the same level of thread safety as `ostringstream`.  That is, you should use a mutex if planning
 * concurrent read/write access to the same object.

   * Why return `const string&` instead of util::String_view?  Answer: By definition we are backed by an `std::string`,
   * either our own or one user actively passed to ctor.  Hence it's unnecessary obfuscation; plus it can lead to
   * errors, like if the user thinks a returned object's `String_view::size()` will auto-adjust based on what happens
   * to the wrapped `std::string` subsequently.  If they want a `String_view`, they can always just construct one, just
   * as we would inside here anyway.
   *
   * @return Read-only reference to string; the address therein is guaranteed to always be the same given a `*this`.
