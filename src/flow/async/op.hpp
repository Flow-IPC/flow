/* See `using Op =` in async_fwd.hpp for a key (in this context) doc header.

/**
 * Simple, immutable `vector`-like sequence of N opaque async::Op objects, usually corresponding to N worker threads,
 * with typically used operations such as `[index]` and random `Op` selection.
 *
 * ### Thread safety ###
 * The object is immutable after construction; therefore each `*this` is safe for concurrent Op_list method calls.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * ### Design rationale ###
 * This really only exists, at least originally, in service of Concurrent_task_loop::per_thread_ops() (which returns
 * an Op_list nowadays).  An alternative approach would have been to move these simple facilities directly into
 * Concurrent_task_loop superclass.  Historically that's how it started; there was a `vector<Op>` directly therein.
 * It worked fine but (1) complicated the otherwise pure interface Concurrent_task_loop into part-interface,
 * part-logic-store-for-subclasses; and (2) increased the required cooperation between subclass and superclass (which is
 * cute in finished code but harder to build on/maintain).  Hence, as experienced OO coders learn eventually,
 * composition (where X is a member of Y) is more flexible and no more verbose than inheritance (where Y is a
 * subclass of X); in both case the desired/achieved effect is to let Y leverage X's abilities.  Hence Op_list is a
 * separate little class to be included as a member by whatever subclass of Concurrent_task_loop needs it.
 *
 * It is also a good sign that Op_list stands alone as a clean, reusable concept.  It may find other uses than
 * in Concurrent_task_loop::per_thread_ops().
